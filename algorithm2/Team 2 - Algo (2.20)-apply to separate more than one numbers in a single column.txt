Contact number separation
If a column in your dataset contains two or more numbers separated with a comma,
Eg: 8978987903,7890789045
 Then you need to run them through this 2.2 algorithm which divides the two numbers into 2 columns, and follow the instructions as specified in the algorithm.


Algorithm Explanation:
Step 1: download the file either in csv format or in excel format


Step 2: read the file in the jupyter notebook in its particular format
 i.e(if you download the file in csv--read_csv(“filename.csv”)
Else if you download it in excel format--read_excel(“filename.xlsx”)


step 3: Data.shape
           Returns tuple of shape (Rows, columns) of dataframe.
   
           Data.head(n)
           It is used to get the first n rows(specify the number you want to get)
   
           Data.describe
           It is used to view some basic statistical details of a data frame


step 4: Drop the null values and reset the index
           If the Mobile Number columns have any extra characters, tackle with 
           them before doing any further operations.


step 5: Creating two lists contact1 and contact2
           Separating the contact numbers with the help of comma
           The numbers before comma are stored in contact1 and the numbers after 
           comma are stored in contact2 list


Step 6: Run the file as mentioned in the document, and be precautious of the
        comments and headings written


step 7: Converting the lists into Dataframe
           Dropping the Duplicates 
           Resetting the index
           Dropping the Phone number column as it is already converted into contact1 and
           contact2
step 8: data.to_excel("Name_team2.xlsx",index=False)
           change the "Name" of the file 
           and it will get downloaded in xlsx format.
